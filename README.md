# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide made for my first project in bootcamp. It was a way to showcase some important notes about the 4 parts in the webpage. It provides easily accessible tips to aide in the learning of HTML, GIT, CSS, and JavaScript. It also has aspects in the console log to give advice on which topic to learn first. I learned a lot about GIT functionality and how important each piece can be to a project.

## Usage

This is a great tool for beginners to use as a guide along their learning process. Each section lists notes about HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. It also has tools in the console that show all four of the topics and gives a suggestion on which topic to study first.
